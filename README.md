# ecommerceUser
This repository contains a lambda function to create users in AWS RDS - MySQL database when a new user is created in AWS Cognito.

## Configuration project
Follow all of these steps to configure the repository:

To create a Go module: 
- **go mod init github.com/luisrojas17/ecommerceUser

To get AWS SDK for this lambda:
- **go get github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda
- **go get github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events
- **go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws
- **go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config
- **go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/secretsmanager
- **go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql

## Dependencies
This project has next AWS dependencies: 

- You have to create user pool in AWS Cognito.
- You have to create a database instance in AWS RDS. In this case, the instance will have to be MySQL.
- You have to create an schema with its tables for database. Load the script:
    ./db/ecommerceSchema.sql
- You have to create a secret in AWS Secrete Manager to store the database credentials.
- Create and config Lambda function. This lambda function will insert a new users created in Cognito once the user confirm the email confirmation sent by Cognito.

## Compilation
This project has to be compiled in linux format since AWS lambda runtime for Go only 
recognize lambda Linux executable. so you have to set next environment variables:

- set GOOS=linux
- set GOARCH=amd64

See the scripts "compile.bat" or "compile.sh"

## AWS resources configuration

### Create user pool in Cognito


    Add new scopes to user pool application
        Go to user pool:            auth_user_group
        Recomendations section:     auth_user_app
        Go to Login Pages Tab and click on "Edit" button

            OpenID Connect scopes: aws.cognito.signin.admin
            Click on "Save changes" button


## Create databse in RDS

### Create Lambda

Add trigger 

When you are going to load the code zip file for your lambda function you will have to add next  environment varirables:

- SecretName=ecommerce_secret


In next section it will be described the process to configure an API gateway to get and request objects from and to S3. Also, you can check next documentation:

https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/api-gateway-upload-image-s3

### Create bucket

    Go to S3 service
    Create bucket
    Select the region:  us-east-1 (is cheper)

    Advanced settings
        Object lock:    Disabled.

    Add security policy to get any file allocated in the bucket
        Go to Bucket ecommerce-app-jlrg
            Go to Permissions tab
                Bucket policy Edit

                    Anyone in this account if you wish read and write for any buckect created. If not, you have to specify the Bucket's ARN name. For example:
                        Resource bucket name:   ecommerce-app-jlrg
                        Resource object name:   * 
                        ARN name:               arn:aws:s3:::ecommerce-app-jlrg
